# Djinn

Djinn is an OCaml binding for the [Tinn](https://github.com/glouw/tinn) machine learning library.

## Features

+ Exact same API as Tinn but in OCaml
+ Tinn types are kept opaque so there is no useless overhead

## In progress

+ Pretty printing facilities
+ Utilities to launch the training of a model without extra lines of code
